Setting up your new documentation project is straightforward. Most of the
essential project settings can be configured within the `settings` folder.

## Settings

This section provides the core settings for your documentation site, such as
defining the site's URL, site icon and title.

```tsx showLineNumbers
export const url = ""; // The URL for your documentation site
export const siteicon = ""; // Icon displayed next to the site name in the header
export const sitename = ""; // Title of your documentation site
```
